    "p4": "We allow the submission of user-generated material (text and images) on our Site. When posting content you should avoid posting any Personal Information because most submitted content is made publicly available immediately. For certain actions you have the ability to remove things you post, removing it from public view immediately. Some information may still be retained in our Application Log, so please contact us using the method(s) described at the end of this document to notify us if our intervention is needed.",
