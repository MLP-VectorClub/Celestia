    "title": "What's this site?",
    "p1": "This website originally started as a new, automatic way to process and store the requests & reservations users want to make. It was born due to the fact that in the past, the handling of comments under journals was done manually. Because of this, there had to be people who checked those comments every once in a while, evaluated them, then updated the journal accordingly. This was a time consuming task, and since the group's staff consists of busy people expecting them to constantly monitor new incoming comments is unrealistic. The initial goal of this website was to provide an easy-to-use interface where new entries can be submitted and added to a list (just like the journals) automatically, eliminating this monotonous task.",
    "p2": "After some time, the idea of moving the old PNG color guide into an easier to use format was brought up and met with positive responses. Since then, the site also houses the vector club's official color guide, with freshly picked colors from recent episodes (and cute little pictures to go with a couple popular characters) among other information such as recommended cutie mark vectors and tag-based search. For easier use in drawing applications individual characters can still be downloaded as PNG files that contain all colors associated with them."
